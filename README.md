## Homework 1

### Tasks

1. **C202: Character Stack Implementation (2 points)**
   - Implement a stack of characters using a dynamic array.
   - Complete the function bodies in `c202.c`.
   
2. **C204: Infix to Postfix Conversion and Evaluation (4 points)**
   - Convert infix expressions to postfix notation and evaluate them.
   - Complete the function bodies in `c204.c`.
   
3. **C206: Doubly Linked List Implementation (4 points)**
   - Implement a doubly linked linear list.
   - Complete the function bodies in `c206.c`.

### Instructions

- Submit the completed files `c202.c`, `c204.c`, and `c206.c` through STUDIS in UTF-8 encoding.
- Verify your implementations using the basic test applications provided (e.g., `c202-test.c`).
- Use the provided Makefile for compilation and testing (`make all`, `make clean`, `make run`).
- Ensure your implementations generate correct results on the server `eva.fit.vutbr.cz` to score full points.
- Avoid modifying function headers or provided header files.
- Add appropriate comments to your code to avoid point deductions.

### Tips

- Extend the basic test applications to catch more errors before submission.
- Focus on completing fewer examples correctly rather than partially solving all examples if time-constrained.

## Homework 2

### Tasks

1. **Hashtable Implementation (3 points)**
   - Implement a hash table with scattered items.
   - Complete the function bodies in `hashtable/hashtable.c`.

2. **Binary Search Tree - Recursive (2.5 points)**
   - Implement operations on a binary search tree recursively.
   - Complete the function bodies in `btree/rec/btree.c`.

3. **Binary Search Tree - Iterative (2.5 points)**
   - Implement operations on a binary search tree iteratively.
   - Complete the function bodies in `btree/iter/btree.c`.

4. **Binary Search Tree - Balancing (2 points)**
   - Implement simple usage and balancing of a binary search tree.
   - Complete the function bodies in `btree/exa/exa.c`.

### Instructions

- Submit the files as a tar archive preserving the directory structure through STUDIS in UTF-8 encoding.
- Verify your implementations using the provided test applications (e.g., `make test`, `make clean`).
- Ensure your solutions compile and run on the server `eva.fit.vutbr.cz` to score full points.
- Do not modify other files or function signatures.

### Tips

- Write additional tests to ensure your implementations handle all edge cases.
- Make sure your code is well-commented and follows the prescribed structure to avoid penalties.

### Directory Structure

Submit your archive with the following structure:

```
xlogin00.tar
└── hashtable
    └── hashtable.c
└── btree
    └── rec
        └── btree.c
    └── iter
        └── btree.c
    └── exa
        └── exa.c
```

## General Guidelines

- Complete the assignments independently and do not publish your solutions.
- Any form of plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration will result in a failing grade and potential disciplinary actions.
- Reach out to the assignment lead via faculty email or the discussion forum for any questions.
